As a Buddhist raised to respect and be curious about the natural world, I earned a B.A. of Biology at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA and graduated in 2021. 

For three years at Occidental, I conducted undergraduate research to investigate how the urban heat island impacts local salamander populations. I also completed an honorâ€™s thesis that explored how urban development decreased connectivity of salamander habitats. I used computational methods in R and Julia such as remote sensing, linear mixed-effects models, and circuit theory. Furthermore, I was a Biostatistics Teaching Assistant and taught first-time users R and basic file management, both in-person and remotely. In addition to my computational biology experience, I worked in the Campus Dining department and promoted food sustainability on campus by leading a bi-annual budget analysis and supporting educational events for students interested in local food systems. 

To continue to pursue my environmental and computational interests, I am currently a candidate for the Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I hope to continue working in urban environmental spaces and utilizing data analysis tools to address issues such as food sustainability.
