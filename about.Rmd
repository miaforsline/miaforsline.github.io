![](about1.jpg){width="70%"}

As a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist, I was raised to respect and be curious about the natural world. My passion for the environment led me to earn a B.A. of Biology (with an Environmental Science emphasis) at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA, where I graduated in 2021.

# Water Conservation in Southern California 

As part of the [Santa Margarita Water District's](https://smwd.com/314/Save-Water) Water Use Efficiency (WUE) team, I lead data analysis and data organization for the District's various water conservation programs. Using tools such as R, RStudio, and ArcGIS Insights:

- I identify residential customers using more water than they are allotted, based on the District's budget-based tiered rate structure. After identifying over-budget customers, I support the WUE field team with virtual and in-person outreach efforts such as emails, phone calls, and community events.
- I lead and support many of the District's state-mandated environmental regulatory compliance reports such as the electronic Annual Report and SAFER Clearinghouse. 
- I assist with special internal projects such as budget estimates and database updates
- I offer data support for external consulting projects such as aerial imagery analysis and Cost of Service Rate Studies 
- I present at conferences such as CalWEP's Peer to Peer 

# Urban Ecology Research: Salamanders and the Urban Heat Island in Los Angeles

For three years at Occidental, I conducted [computational biology research](https://compbio.oxycreates.org/) to investigate how the urban heat island impacts local salamanders. This research culminated in a senior [Biology Honors Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvZ7s-Kp3Kz1PhLf399Tqh9A_eG1TvEj/view?usp=sharing), in which I explored how urbanization:

-   impacts temperatures in microhabitats of salamanders ([*Batrachoseps nigriventris*](http://www.californiaherps.com/salamanders/pages/b.nigriventris.html), the black-bellied slender salamander)
-   and influences connectivity of salamander (*B. nigriventris* and [*Batrachoseps major*](https://amphibiaweb.org/species/5340), the garden slender salamander) habitat patches.

I learned and executed computational methods in R and Julia such as:

-   downloading remotely sensed [National Land Cover Data](https://www.mrlc.gov/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-2016) from the [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium](https://www.mrlc.gov/) to identify urban and rural areas in Los Angeles County
-   building linear mixed-effects models using the `lme4` R package
-   utilizing AIC/AICc scores and AIC weights to identify the best model among multiple candidate models
-   building isolation-by-resistance models, based on [circuit theory](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-017-0548-1.pdf), to calculate resistance distance and quantify landscape connectivity of habitat patches and help predict wildlife mobility

# Food Sustainability at Occidental College

In addition to my biology-focused interest in urban ecology, I am passionate about urban food systems, food sustainability, and food equity. For three years, I worked as a Sustainable Procurement Analysis Intern in [Occidental College's Campus Dining department](https://www.oxy.edu/student-life/campus-dining/sustainability/real-food-challenge). Occidental participated in the [Real Food Challenge](https://www.realfoodchallenge.org/), a national campaign to encourage college campuses to shift their purchasing towards local, organic, fair, and/or humane food sources. To reach our goal of spending 30% of Occidental College's food budget on sustainable food, I led a intern team of 3-5 students to complete 5 bi-annual budget analyses. We reached 29% sustainable food by 2019 and were on track to reach our 2020 goal of 30% before the COVID-19 pandemic.
