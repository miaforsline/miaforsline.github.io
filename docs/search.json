For three years at Occidental, I conducted undergraduate research to investigate how the urban heat island impacts local salamander populations. To pursue my environmental and computational interests, I am currently completing a Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara.\n            \n            \n              As a Buddhist raised to respect and be curious about the natural world, I earned a B.A. of Biology (with an Environmental Science emphasis) at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA and graduated in 2021.
