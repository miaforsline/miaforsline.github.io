My passion for the environment led me to earn a B.A. of Biology (with an Environmental Science emphasis) at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA, where I graduated in 2021.\nResearch\nFor three years at Occidental, I conducted computational biology research to investigate how the urban heat island impacts local salamander populations. This research culminated in senior Biology Honors Thesis, in which I explored how urbanization:\nimpacts temperatures in microhabitats of local salamanders (Batrachoseps nigriventris, or the black-bellied slender salamander)\nand influences connectivity of salamander (B. nigriventris and Batrachoseps major, the garden slender salamander) habitat patches.\n\nI learned and executed computational methods in R and Julia such as:\ndownloading remotely sensed National Land Cover Data from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium to identify urban vs rural areas in Los Angeles County\nbuilding linear mixed-effects models using the lme4 package\nutilizing AIC/AICc scores and AIC weights to identify the best model among multiple candidate models\nbuilding isolation-by-resistance models, based on circuit theory, to calculate resistance distance and quantify landscape connectivity for wildlife mobility\nIn this study, we utilized community science and landscape resistance modeling in order to study landscape connectivity for the two salamander species. Our results demonstrate the successful incorporation of community science observation data into the connectivity models, a valuable step forward in streamlining landscape connectivity research.\nProfessional Experience\nFurthermore, I was a Biostatistics Teaching Assistant and taught first-time users R and basic file management, both in-person and remotely. In addition to my computational biology experience, I worked in the Campus Dining department and promoted food sustainability on campus by leading a bi-annual budget analysis and supporting educational events for students interested in local food systems.\nFuture\nTo continue to pursue my environmental and computational interests, I am currently a candidate for the Master of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I hope to continue working in urban environmental spaces and utilizing data analysis tools to address issues such as food sustainability.\n\n\n\n",
