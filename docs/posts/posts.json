Is there existing evidence on this question? If so, why is it inconclusive? If not, why not?\nMethods\nData Description / Collection\nWhere did you access it? What are its spatial and temporal features? What are its limitations? What do you know about the sampling strategy and what biases that may introduce? If helpful, you can use a histogram, scatterplot, or summary statistics table to describe your data.\nI downloaded several yearsâ€™ worth of CalEnviroScreen data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and the California Open Data Portal :\nVersions 1.1 (Sept 2013)\nVersions 2.0 (Oct 2014)\nVersions 3.0 (June 2018)\nVersions 4.0 (Oct 2021)\nEach CalEnviroScreen dataset contains X columns of:\nenvironmental pollution burden indicators\nexposure indicators such as PM2.5\nenvironmental effects indicators such as groundwater threats\n\npopulation characteristics:\nsensitive population indicators such as rates of asthma\nsocioeconomic factor indicators such as rates of poverty\n\nCalEnviroScreen Components (Source: https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen40reportf2021.pdf)Each dataset also contains one row per census tract for a total of X rows, meaning each census tract in California is assigned a value per environmental indicator or population characteristic.\nIn particular, I am interested in:\nPM2.5: the annual mean concentration of PM2.5, which CalEnviroScreen calculates based on a weighted average of measured monitor concentrations and satellite observations (ug/m3) over 3 years\nPoverty: the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level, which CalEnviroScreen calculates using a 5-year estimate\nTherefore, we can use this data to explore how PM2.5 and poverty rates\nStatistical Analysis\nWhat is your analysis plan? Why did you choose this analysis, given your data and question? What are the limitations?\nResults\nShow us your results in figure(s) and/or table(s) that are carefully labeled and captioned. Describe in the text (and orally when presenting) what you found, and how these results either do or do not help you answer your question.\nFigures\nConclusions\nFuture Directions\nOne short analysis cannot fully answer an interesting scientific question. If you had time to collect more data or conduct more analysis, what would help you answer this question better?\n\n\n\n",
