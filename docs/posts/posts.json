Is there existing evidence on this question? If so, why is it inconclusive? If not, why not?\nMethods\nData Description / Collection\nWhere did you access it? What are its spatial and temporal features? What are its limitations? What do you know about the sampling strategy and what biases that may introduce? If helpful, you can use a histogram, scatterplot, or summary statistics table to describe your data.\n\n\nc1 <- read_csv(file = here(\"_posts\", \n                           \"2021-11-18-calenviroscreen\", \n                           \"CES\", \n                           \"CES_data\", \n                           \"ces1_2013.csv\"))\nc2 <- read_csv(file = here(\"_posts\", \n                           \"2021-11-18-calenviroscreen\", \n                           \"CES\", \n                           \"CES_data\", \n                           \"ces2_2014.csv\"))\nc3 <- read_csv(file = here(\"_posts\", \n                           \"2021-11-18-calenviroscreen\", \n                           \"CES\", \n                           \"CES_data\", \n                           \"ces3_2018.csv\"))\nc4 <- read_csv(file = here(\"_posts\", \n                           \"2021-11-18-calenviroscreen\", \n                           \"CES\", \n                           \"CES_data\", \n                           \"ces4_2021.csv\"))\n\nc1_clean <- c1 %>% \n  select(c(\"ZIP Code\",\"Poverty\", \"PM2.5\")) %>% \n  mutate(\"Census Tract\" = \"NA\",\n         \"California County\" = \"NA\",\n         \"Longitude\" = \"NA\",\n         \"Latitude\" = \"NA\") %>% \n  rename(\"ZIP\" = \"ZIP Code\") %>% \n  select(c(\"Census Tract\", \"California County\", \"ZIP\", \"Longitude\", \"Latitude\", \"Poverty\", \"PM2.5\")) %>% \n  mutate(Year = \"2013\")\nc2_clean <- c2 %>% \n  select(c(\"Census Tract\", \"California County\", \"ZIP\", \"Longitude\", \"Latitude\", \"Poverty\", \"PM2.5\")) %>% \n  mutate(Year = \"2014\")\nc3_clean <- c3 %>% \n  select(c(\"Census Tract\", \"California County\", \"ZIP\", \"Longitude\", \"Latitude\", \"Poverty\", \"PM2.5\")) %>% \n  mutate(Year = \"2018\")\nc4_clean <- c4 %>% \n  select(c(\"Census Tract\", \"California County\", \"ZIP\", \"Longitude\", \"Latitude\", \"Poverty\", \"PM2.5\")) %>% \n  mutate(Year = \"2021\")\n\n\n\n\n\njoined <- rbind(c4_clean, c3_clean, c2_clean, c1_clean) %>% \n  mutate(Year = as.factor(Year),\n         Year = factor(x = Year, levels = c(\"2013\", \"2014\", \"2018\", \"2021\"))) \n\n\n\nI downloaded 2013 - 2021 CalEnviroScreen data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and the California Open Data Portal :\nVersions 1.1 (Sept 2013)\nVersions 2.0 (Oct 2014)\nVersions 3.0 (June 2018)\nVersions 4.0 (Oct 2021)\nEach CalEnviroScreen dataset contains columns of:\nenvironmental pollution burden indicators\nexposure indicators such as PM2.5\nenvironmental effects indicators such as groundwater threats\n\npopulation characteristics:\nsensitive population indicators such as rates of asthma\nsocioeconomic factor indicators such as rates of poverty\n\nCalEnviroScreen Components (Source: https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen40reportf2021.pdf)Each dataset also contains one row per census tract, meaning each census tract in California is assigned a value per environmental indicator or population characteristic.\nIn particular, I am interested in:\nPM2.5: the annual mean concentration of PM2.5, which CalEnviroScreen calculates based on a weighted average of measured monitor concentrations and satellite observations (ug/m3) over 3 years. For example, the CES 1.1. report used data from 2007 - 2009 while the CES 4.0 report used 2015 - 2017. All reports used data from the California Air Resources Board’s Air Monitoring Network. In addition to the Air Monitoring Network, CES 3.0 and 4.0 incorporated Satellite Remote Sensing Data.\n\n\nggplot(data = joined, aes(x = PM2.5)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Year)) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol = 1) + \n  labs(title = \"2013 - 2021 mean concentration of PM2.5 in California\", \n       x = \"Annual mean concentration of PM2.5 per census tract (ug/m3)\", \n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData were more likely to be high resolution around certain cities or localized areas, but not all cities have air monitoring stations. Depending on the year, locales with little to no data were either omitted or estimated using nearby locations’ data. For example, in CES 1.1, census tracts with centers > 50km away from the nearest air monitor were omitted from the analysis. In CES 4.0, missing data was estimated using regression relationships with nearby sites.\nPM2.5 annual mean monitoring data were extracted from all monitoring sites where possible. For CES 4.0, PM2.5 annual mean concentrations were also calculated using Aerosol Optical Depth measurements as well as land use and meteorology data via regression on ground monitor data.\nFor CES 1.1 - 3.0, the geographic center of each census tract, quarterly mean PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using ordinary kringing. For CES 4.0, overall PM2.5 annual mean concentrations were estimated for each 1km x 1km grid cell using both the monitoring and satellite data in a weighted average. An inverse-distance weighting method was used, so grid cells close to monitors relied more heavily on monitor estimates while grid cells further from monitors relied more heavily on satellite data. Grid cells with monitors > 50km away relied solely on satellite data. Concentrations were estimated at the center of each 1km x 1km grid cell.\nThe quarterly estimates were then averaged to calculate annual means. The annual means were estimated over 3 years to avoid account for uneven sampling frequency.\nCalEnviroScreen 4.0 PM2.5 Map (Source: https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen40reportf2021.pdf)Poverty: the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level, which CalEnviroScreen calculates using a 5-year estimate. For example, the CES 1.1 report used a 5-year estimate from 2007 - 2011 data while the CES 4.0 report used a 5-year estimate from 2015 - 2019 data. Poverty data came from the American Community Survey. Multiple years of data are used to calculate more reliable results for geographic areas with small populations.\n\n\nggplot(data = joined, aes(x = Poverty)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Year)) + \n  theme_classic() + \n  facet_wrap(~Year, ncol = 1) + \n  labs(title = \"2013 - 2021 mean concentration of PM2.5 in California\", \n       x = \"% of population per census tract living below two times the federal poverty\nlevel\", \n       y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\nCalEnviroScreen defined poverty as twice below the federal poverty line to account for California’s high cost of living relative to other states and because the federal poverty threshold has not changed since the 1980s despite the cost of living increasing over time.\nThe percent per census tract was calculated by individuals living below 200% the poverty level per census tract / total individuals living below 200% of the poverty level.\nStandard error and relative standard error were calculated to determine the reliability of the calculated poverty rate. Census tracts with unreliable estimates were assigned no value for poverty rate (NULL).\nCalEnviroScreen 4.0 Poverty Map (Source: https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen40reportf2021.pdf)Using this data, we can answer the research question…\nStatistical Analysis\nWhat is your analysis plan?
