As a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist, I was raised to respect and be curious about the natural world. My passion for the environment led me to earn a B.A. of Biology at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA, where I conducted [computational biology research](https://compbio.oxycreates.org/) to investigate how the urban heat island impacts local salamander populations, and to obtain my [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I currently apply my data analysis skills towards local water conservation at the [Santa Margarita Water District](https://www.smwd.com/) in Orange County, CA.
